# LPC Revised
This is a rework of the Liberated Pixel Cup pixel art asset kit. LPC uses a bright 128 color palette and a 32x32 tile resolution. I aim to curate and add pieces to this set to expand it while remaining consistent in style and tone.

Licensing is CC-by-SA 3, with a universal exception waived for DRM. This, essentially, means this assets can be used in commercial games on platforms like iOS, so long as the source is credited.

New work will be added to this repository as I complete it, so anyone can come here to get the latest, most complete collection to date, with detailed credit files supplied. If this kit is missing an element anyone very much wants to see, I take suggestions and commisions at my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DeathsDarling

Happy gaming!
