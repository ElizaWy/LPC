# Welcome to the LPC Revised Project!
Welcome to the Liberated Pixel Cup Revised (LPC Revised) project, a vibrant repository of creative-commons licensed game assets! We're proud to foster an open and collaborative platform for indie game developers worldwide.

Our assets are lovingly crafted in a 32-pixel style, with a three-quarters (top-down) perspective. This style harkens back to timeless classics like Chrono Trigger and Link to the Past. Each piece uses a bright and diverse color palette, encompassing approximately 170 colors, to ensure aesthetic harmony throughout the project.

We've also given special attention to our character design, creating larger-than-average sprites that offer more room for creative expression and detail.

This repository offers assets spanning multiple themes - Fantasy, Modern, and (eventually) Sci-Fi, providing game creators the building blocks needed to construct their unique game worlds. For an easy browsing experience, our assets are intuitively organized by theme and type.

Each asset is listed in a credit.txt file located in the same directory as the asset file, containing the name of the original author and any other relevant information about their work. We believe in giving credit where it's due.

All of our assets are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC-BY-3.0) or OGA-by 3.0 License, allowing you to freely use, modify, and distribute these assets in your own projects, provided you give appropriate attribution. OGA-BY is a license based on CC-BY 3.0 that removes that license's restriction on technical measures that prevent redistribution of a work. This, essentially, means this assets can be used in commercial games on platforms like iOS, so long as the source is credited.

We're excited to see what incredible worlds you'll create using our assets!
