# LPC Revised
This is a rework of the Liberated Pixel Cup pixel art asset kit. LPC uses a bright 128 color palette and a 32x32 tile resolution. I aim to curate and add pieces to this set to expand it while remaining consistent in style and tone.

Licensing is CC-by-SA 4, with a universal exception waived for DRM. This, essentially, means this assets can be used in commercial games on platforms like Steam, so long as the source is credited.
