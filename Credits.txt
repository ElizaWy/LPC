
Hello and welcome to the LPC Revised collection!

This graphics pack was lovingly hand drawn, curated, and compiled by the tireless efforts of artists in the Creative Commons community, and by the volunteers at OpenGameArt.org. We're happy to support game developers with free, open content!

This pack is licensed OGA-BY 3.0. This means you can use these graphics free of charge, even for commercial use, so long as the artists are credited. I would also appreciate a link to this GitHub for future game devs!

These are all the artists who've contributed to this project:

	Eliza Wyatt (DeathsDarling)
	Lanea Zimmerman (Sharm)
	Stephen Challener (Redshrike)
	Johannes Sj√∂lund (Wulax)
	BlueCarrot16
	BenCreating
	Durrani
	YuriNikolai
	Craftpix.net 2D Game Assets


If you only wish to use a small part of the LPC Revised kit, every spritesheet is accompanied by an entry in its local credits file.
